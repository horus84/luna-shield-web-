# --- Core FastAPI & Server ---
fastapi
uvicorn[standard]  # Includes performance extras like uvloop, httptools
gunicorn         # Process manager for running uvicorn workers in production

# --- Templating & Static Files ---
jinja2

# --- Data Handling & Forms ---
python-multipart # Required by FastAPI for file uploads/form data
aiofiles         # For asynchronous file operations (often used by FastAPI)

# --- Machine Learning & Computer Vision ---
torch            # PyTorch core library (Check CPU/GPU version needed!)
torchvision      # PyTorch library for vision tasks, models, transforms (Check CPU/GPU version!)
opencv-python-headless # OpenCV for video/image processing (server-friendly version)
numpy            # Fundamental package for numerical computing
Pillow           # Python Imaging Library (Fork) for image manipulation

# --- Training & Evaluation Script Dependencies (full_pipe.py) ---
scikit-learn     # For evaluation metrics (classification_report, confusion_matrix)
matplotlib       # For plotting graphs (confusion matrix, frame predictions)
seaborn          # For enhanced visualizations (heatmap)
tqdm             # Progress bars for loops
reportlab        # For generating PDF reports

# Note: Review package versions. It's best practice to pin versions
# using 'pip freeze > requirements.txt' in your working development environment.
# Example: fastapi==0.95.1
# Example: torch==1.13.1+cpu (if using CPU-only)
